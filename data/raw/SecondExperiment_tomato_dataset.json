  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is the critical night temperature threshold?",
    "output": "21°C is the critical threshold. Above this, pollen viability drops and fruit set is significantly impaired."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What minimum night temperature should I maintain?",
    "output": "Minimum is 15°C for winter production. Below this, fruit set drops by 10% and ripening is delayed."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What night temperature during fruit development?",
    "output": "16-18°C is optimal during active fruit growth. This maximizes fruit size while maintaining plant vigor."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What happens if night temperature exceeds 24°C?",
    "output": "Fruit set drops dramatically and pollen becomes non-viable. Proline transport to pollen grains is inhibited above 24°C."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What night temperature for flowering stage?",
    "output": "Maintain 17-19°C during flowering. This critical range ensures viable pollen and successful fruit set."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is DIF in tomato temperature management?",
    "output": "DIF is day temperature minus night temperature. Optimal DIF is 5-8°C for balanced vegetative and reproductive growth."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Is negative DIF ever beneficial for tomatoes?",
    "output": "No, negative DIF (cooler days than nights) reduces growth by 30-40% and delays flowering significantly."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What DIF during flowering period?",
    "output": "Maintain DIF of 6-8°C (25°C day/18°C night) during flowering. This optimizes pollen viability and fruit set."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should DIF vary by tomato variety?",
    "output": "Yes, indeterminate varieties tolerate wider DIF (6-10°C) better than determinate types which prefer 4-7°C."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Temperature during fruit set stage?",
    "output": "Critical to maintain 22-25°C day and 16-19°C night during fruit set. This window lasts 10-15 days per cluster."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Tomatoes not coloring properly. Temperature issue?",
    "output": "Yes, temperatures above 30°C inhibit lycopene synthesis. Also check if below 13°C which delays color development."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Slow fruit development despite good health?",
    "output": "Increase temperature slightly if below 20°C average. Each degree below 20°C delays ripening by 2-3 days."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Why are my tomatoes small this season?",
    "output": "Review temperature logs. Sustained temperatures above 26°C reduce fruit size by 5-8% per degree increase."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Blossom end rot appearing frequently?",
    "output": "Temperature stress above 32°C or below 15°C impairs calcium transport. Stabilize temperature and check irrigation."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is heat sum or growing degree days?",
    "output": "Sum of daily temperatures above 10°C base. Tomatoes need 1500-2000 GDD from transplant to first harvest."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is vernalization requirement for tomatoes?",
    "output": "Tomatoes have no vernalization requirement. However, 7-10 days at 15-17°C after transplant improves fruit set."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What causes hollow fruit related to temperature?",
    "output": "Sustained temperatures above 30°C during fruit set cause poor pollination and hollow fruits. Maintain 22-26°C."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Best temperature strategy for cherry tomatoes?",
    "output": "Cherry types tolerate slightly higher temperatures. Use 24-28°C day and 18-20°C night without yield loss."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What temperature for cluster tomatoes?",
    "output": "Maintain 23-26°C for uniform cluster development. Temperature variation causes uneven ripening within cluster."
  },
  {

    "instruction": "Temperature for colored variety tomatoes?",
    "output": "Yellow/orange varieties need 22-26°C for color. Purple/black types tolerate slightly cooler 20-24°C."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What temperature for aeroponic tomato production?",
    "output": "Aeroponics requires 18-20°C root zone and 22-26°C air. Higher root temperature encourages pathogens."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Temperature in aquaponic tomato system?",
    "output": "Balance fish needs (24-28°C) with tomato preference (18-22°C) at root. Use 20-24°C water as compromise."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is critical temperature for tomato survival?",
