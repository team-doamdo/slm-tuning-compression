        "question": "One-sided yellowing and wilting of leaves; older leaves become necrotic; smaller fruits. Answer in short.",
        "answer": "Nutrient deficiency. \n\nHere’s why:\n\n*   **One-sided yellowing:** Indicates a specific nutrient (often nitrogen or potassium) is lacking on one side of the plant.\n*   **Wilting of leaves:** Often accompanies yellowing as the plant struggles to maintain turgor pressure.\n*   **Necrotic older leaves:**  Happens when the plant can’t maintain water uptake.\n*   **Smaller fruits:** Nutrient deficiencies directly impact fruit development.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on the causes of nutrient deficiencies?",
