        "question": "Why are my tomatoes experiencing leaf curling during the fruit development stage? Answer in short.",
        "answer": "Leaf curling in tomatoes during fruit development is most often caused by **high temperatures and/or water stress**. It's a defense mechanism to reduce sun exposure and conserve water. \n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Heat:** Temperatures above 85°F (29°C) trigger curling.\n*   **Water:** Lack of consistent watering can also cause it.\n\n**To help:** Provide consistent watering, shade during the hottest parts of the day, and ensure good air circulation.",
