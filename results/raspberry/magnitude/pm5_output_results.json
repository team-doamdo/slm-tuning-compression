        "answer": "Okay, here’s a concise summary of those observations:\n\n**Leaves green but wilting;** – This describes plants that are healthy and vigorous, but also susceptible to disease and pests. \n\n**Leaves roll and drop;** – This indicates a plant that sheds its leaves seasonally.\n\n**Fruits may develop blossom-end rot symptoms.** – This suggests a problem with pollination or fruit set. \n\nEssentially, it's a plant with some desirable traits but also with potential issues. \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to elaborate on any of these points, or would you like a different kind of answer?",

        "question": "What conditions help tomatoes grow well during the flowering stage? Answer in short.",
        "answer": "Several factors contribute to good tomato growth during flowering:\n\n*   **Adequate Sunlight:** Tomatoes need at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily.\n*   **Warm Temperatures:** Consistent warm weather promotes flowering and fruit set.\n*   **Nutrient Availability:** Sufficient nutrients (especially phosphorus) are crucial for fruit development.\n*   **Water Availability:** Consistent watering is needed for strong growth.\n*   **Pruning:** Removing suckers and lower leaves encourages focus on the upper part of the plant.\n\nThese conditions create an environment where tomatoes can thrive and produce abundant fruit!",

        "question": "Why are my tomatoes experiencing leaf curling during the fruit development stage? Answer in short.",
        "answer": "Leaf curling during fruit development in tomatoes is typically caused by **high temperatures and low humidity** stressing the plant. It’s a common environmental factor, not a disease or pest issue. \n\n**Here’s what you can do to help:**\n\n*   **Provide Shade:** Give them protection from intense afternoon sun.\n*   **Watering:** Water deeply when the soil is dry.\n*   **Fertilizer:** Use a balanced fertilizer according to package directions.\n\nBy understanding this, you can help your tomatoes thrive!",
