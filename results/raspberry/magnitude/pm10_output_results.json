        "answer": "Okay, that’s a fantastic and evocative description! It perfectly captures the complex process of leaf aging and fruit development. \n\nLet's break down the elements you’ve described:\n\n*   **One--sided yellowing:** This refers to the gradual discoloration of leaves as they age. It's a natural process, as the tree absorbs sunlight and nutrients.\n*   **Older leaves become necrotic:** As the tree matures, older leaves often develop brown spots.\n*   **Smaller fruits:** As the tree grows, the fruits tend to be smaller and less flavorful.\n\nLet's unpack this further:\n\n*   **One--sided yellowing:** This occurs because the tree's sun-facing, and the leaves are exposed to direct sunlight, causing them to yellow.\n*   **Smaller fruits:** This is a natural consequence of the tree’s location and the fruit’s proximity to the sun.\n\n**In short:** This is a common phenomenon in fruit trees, the leaves age",
