        "answer": "Leaf curling in tomatoes is a complex interplay of factors, and while not always a single cause, it can be a combination of factors. Here's a breakdown of the most common reasons and how to address it:\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n\n*   **Nutrient Deficiencies:** Lack of nitrogen, magnesium, or iron can trigger this.\n*   **Environmental Stress:** Temperature fluctuations, prolonged exposure to sunlight, and high humidity can lead to this.\n*   **Fungal Infections:** *Fusarium wilt* is a common culprit.\n*   **Insect Infestations:** *Aphids and whiteflies can be a major factor.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n*   **Nutrient Correction:** Apply magnesium sulfate and trace elements.\n*   **Temperature Regulation:** Reduce the temperature fluctuations.\n*   **Fungal Control:** Use copper-based fungicides.\n*   **Insect Control:** Use insecticides specifically for aphids and whiteflies.\n*   **Proper Watering:** Water regularly, and water thoroughly.\n*   **Good Ventilation:** Improve air circulation around the plants.",
