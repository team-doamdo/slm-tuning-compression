        "question": "Why are my tomatoes not developing good growth? Answer in short.",
        "answer": "Here's a breakdown of common reasons and quick fixes:\n\n*   **Sunlight:** Tomatoes need at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily.\n*   **Water:** Consistent watering, deeply and regularly, is crucial.\n*   **Nutrients:**  They need fertilizer (tomato food).\n*   **Soil:** Poor soil can limit growth. Amend with compost.\n*   **Temperature:** Too hot or too cold can hinder growth.\n*   **Pests/Disease:** Inspect for issues and treat promptly.\n\nTo help me give you more specific advice, could you tell me:\n\n*   What kind of tomatoes are you growing (determinate, indeterminate)?\n*   What's your climate like?\n*   Can you describe the leaves (yellowing, curling, etc.)?",

        "question": "Unilateral wilting of plants with light colored streaks on leaf midrib, petiole, and stem. Answer in short.",
        "answer": "This sounds like **Verticillium wilt**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Unilateral wilting:**  The symptom is localized to one side of the plant.\n*   **Light colored streaks:** This is a hallmark of *Verticillium* infections – the vascular system becomes blocked, causing a discoloration.\n*   **Leaf midrib, petiole, and stem:** The fungus attacks the vascular tissue, causing damage in these areas.\n\n**Important Note:** While *Verticillium wilt* is the most likely cause, other fungal diseases can also cause similar symptoms.  A plant pathologist would need to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n**Disclaimer:** *I am an AI Chatbot and not a plant pathologist. This information is for general knowledge and should not be considered as a definitive diagnosis.*",
